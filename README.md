## NZASP Ratings System Software

This is at the stage of being a minimally-complete implementation of the new ratings system. Am currently working on documentation sufficient that someone else can work out how to use it without having to trawl through the source code. I am currently using this version compiled for Mac OS X to maintain the ratings system. You should be able to run the project with the current Xojo IDE ( from xojo.com), but you would need to have a currently paid-up subscription to Xojo to compile the project. If you want to try out a compiled version, let me know and I can send a copy.

To come less imminently:
- test compile in the Windows version of the IDE
- test compile for Linux
- much refactoring
- a way to produce lists for changing criteria for Trans-Tasman selection
